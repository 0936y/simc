Description: Combat simulator for World of Warcraft (tm) (graphical interface).
 SimulationCraft is a tool to explore combat mechanics in the popular 
 MMO RPG World of Warcraft (tm).
 It is a multi-player event driven simulator written in C++ that models
 player character damage-per-second in various raiding scenarios.
 .
 Increasing class synergy and the prevalence of proc-based combat modifiers
 have eroded the accuracy of traditional calculators that rely upon closed-form
 approximations to model very complex mechanics.
 The goal of this simulator is to close the accuracy gap while maintaining a
 performance level high enough to calculate relative stat weights to aid gear
 selection.
 .
 SimulationCraft allows raid/party creation of arbitrary size, generating
 detailed charts and reports for both individual and raid performance.
 .
 This package only contains the graphical user interface for SimulationCraft.
 If you want the command line tool, please install `simulationcraft-cli`.
