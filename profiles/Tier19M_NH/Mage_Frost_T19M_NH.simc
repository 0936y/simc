# Basic Water Jet combo. Since Water Jet can only be used if the actor is not casting, we use it right after Frostbolt is executed. At the default distance, Frostbolt travels slightly over 1 s, giving Water Jet enough time to apply the DoT (Water Jet's cast time is 1 s, with haste scaling). The APL then forces another Frostbolt to guarantee getting both FoFs from the Water Jet. This works for most haste values (roughly from 0% to 160%). When changing the default distance, great care must be taken otherwise this action won't produce two FoFs.

# Winter's Chill from Flurry can apply to the spell cast right before (provided the travel time is long enough). This can be exploited to a great effect with Ebonbolt, Glacial Spike (which deal a lot of damage by themselves) and Frostbolt (as a guaranteed way to proc Frozen Veins and Chain Reaction). With T20 Bonuses, it is worth it to sit on BrainFreeze procs in order to shatter Glacial Spike inside the Frozen Orb duration Critical Damage Buff, but only if Frozen Orb is nearly ready to be used. Additionally, we do not want to sit on BrainFreeze procs too long; so unless we have a high Icicle count we ignore Glacial Spike and continue with standard use.

# Freezing Rain Blizzard. While the normal Blizzard action is usually enough, right after Frozen Orb the actor will be getting a lot of FoFs, which might delay Blizzard to the point where we miss out on Freezing Rain.
